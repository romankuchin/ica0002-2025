# Lab 3

Goal of this lab is to deploy a simple web application with Ansible.

The application itself is rather trivial but all the stack needed to get it running may be somewhat
challenging to set up.

We recommend approaching the problems one by one, and moving in smaller steps. This is the fastest
way to complete these tasks.


## The application

We couldn't find any good web application for you to practice on -- which is not too easy nor
too difficult to set up, so we've created out own :)

Meet the [AGAMA: A (very) Generic App to Manage Anything](https://github.com/hudolejev/agama).

Goal of this task is to get this application running on your server, in the simplest possible but
still automated production-grade way.


## Before you start

Update your Ansible inventory file from the [lab 2](../02-toolchain) and change your virtual machine
connection parameters. You can find these on your page
[in this list](http://193.40.157.25/students.html).

Note that this step is needed every next day to run your Ansible successfully; virtual machines are
rebuilt every night, and connection details are changed.


## Task 1: cleanup

Comment out the tasks in the `init` role that create users and authorize SSH keys for Juri and Roman
(added in the task 2 of the previous lab) -- we don't need these anymore, but you may want to keep
the code for future reference:

    #- name: ...
    #  ansible.builtin.user:
    #    ...

Your `init` role should now contain only one active (not commented out) task: the one that updates
APT cahce (added in the task 3 of the previous lab).


## Task 2: install the application

Create an Ansible role named `agama` that deploys the AGAMA application on the managed host. If you
don't remember the exact file structure in the role subdirectory -- check out the Ansible related
slides from the lab 2.

This role should ensure that:
 1. There is a system user named `agama`
 2. There is the directory `/opt/agama` owned by user `agama`
 3. All the application dependencies are installed
 4. The application itself is installed in the `/opt/agama` directory

For step 1 use Asnible module `user` as you did in the previous lab.

For step 2 use Ansible module
[file](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/file_module.html)
with attribute `state: directory`.

For steps 3 and 4 check out
[AGAMA installation instructions](https://github.com/hudolejev/agama#installation).

For step 3 use Ansible module `apt` as you did in the previous lab to install APT packages.

**Do NOT install the packages using `pip` on this lab!**

For step 4 use Ansible module
[get_url](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/get_url_module.html)
to download publicly available files from the Internet to the managed host.

Then, update a play `Web server` created in the previous lab and add a role named `agama` to the
role list. Note that this role should be added **before** `nginx` -- we'll need the application to
be fully set up before configuring the web server.

This play should apply a role named `agama` on every web server, i. e. should contain something
like this:

    hosts: web_servers
    roles:
      - agama
      - nginx

Once done, run Ansible to set up Agama, and make sure it executes sucessfully:

    ansible-playbook infra.yaml

After that you can verify that the application is working by running this command on the
**managed host** as user `ubuntu`:

    sudo -u agama AGAMA_DATABASE_URI=sqlite:////opt/agama/test.sqlite3 python3 /opt/agama/agama.py

This is a temporary manual step just to verify the result. Don't do it with Ansible please.

You should see this line in the output, without any errors (you'll see a warning about development
server though):

     * Serving Flask app 'agama'
     * Debug mode: off
    WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment Use a production WSGI server instead.
     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    Press CTRL+C to quit

Note that it's **not** the proper way to run web applications, but is good enough for this lab to
test your solution at this stage.

If you feel that something is not working as expected -- fix it first before approaching the next
task.


## Task 3: install uWSGI

Create an Ansible role named `uwsgi` the deploys [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io) on the
managed host. uWSGI is an application container server that will run our application.

This role should ensure that:
 1. uWSGI packages are installed; needed Ubuntu 24.04 packages are named `uwsgi` and
    `uwsgi-plugin-python3`, you can check the package details here: https://packages.ubuntu.com/.
 2. uWSGI configuration for AGAMA application is added to `/etc/uwsgi/apps-enabled/agama.ini` file;
    requirements:
     - AGAMA application should be run by user `agama`.
     - uWSGI should listen on local interface (`localhost` or `127.0.0.1`); alternatively, you can
       use UNIX socket file if you want.
     - AGAMA should be configured to use SQLite3 database located at `/opt/agama/db.sqlite3` -- no
       need to _create_ this file explicitly: AGAMA will create it automatically when needed.
 3. uWSGI service is restarted automatically if uWSGI configuration is changed; note that uWSGI
    service shoud **not** be restarted if uWSGI configuration has not been changed.

 > Note: uWSGI on Debian/Ubuntu is pre-configured to read existing configuration files automatically
 > from `/etc/uwsgi/apps-enabled` directory. This is Debian/Ubuntu specific behavior brought to you
 > by `uwsgi` package from the APT repository; default (upstream) uWSGI is configured differently.

For step 2 use the Ansible module `copy` and check out
[AGAMA deployment instructions](https://github.com/hudolejev/agama#running) --  it has uWSGI
configuration file example for MySQL; you will need to adjust it for SQLite.

If you feel that AGAMA configuration example is not enough -- uWSGI configuration reference can be
found [here](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Options.html).

For step 3 use
[Ansible handlers](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_handlers.html)
to handle service restarts correctly; also check out the slides about Ansible handlers.

Then, update a play `Web servers` and add a role named `uwsgi` to the role list. Note that this role
should be added **after** `agama` but **before** `nginx` -- we'll need the application to be fully
set up before configuring uWSGI, and that should be completed before configuring the web server:

    roles:
      - agama
      - uwsgi
      - nginx

Once done, run Ansible to set up uWSGI, and make sure it executes sucessfully:

    ansible-playbook infra.yaml

After that you can verify that uWSGI is started by running this command manually on a managed host
(port number will be different if you changed it in the uWSGI app configuration):

    ss -l | grep 5000

You should see the output very similar to this (last column may differ):

    tcp  LISTEN  0  100  127.0.0.1:5000  0.0.0.0:*

This is an indication that uWSGI is set up correctly.

If you feel that something is not working as expected -- fix it first before approaching the next
task.

Hints:
 - uWSGI logs can be found in `/var/log/uwsgi/app` directory. If something is not working as
   expected you will probably find an answer there. You can read logs using `cat`, `tail`, `less`,
   `grep` or any other tools available.
 - You can additionaly run `systemctl status uwsgi` on the managed host to check the uWSGI system
   service status, and view a few latest logged messages -- it is often helpful for debugging.
 - To test the automatic service restart you can simulate a configuration file change by adding or
   deleting an empty line to it; this change means nothing to uWSGI but triggers a change for
   Ansible.


## Task 4: manage uWSGI service

Debian and Ubuntu packages have convention to start the installed service automatically after the
installation, and also enable the service to run on system boot automatically. Although this may
be convenient in some cases, do not take this behavior as granted:
 - this is just a convention for some APT repositories only, not a global rule, so even some Debian
   packages may not follow it
 - this is overall a Debian specific behavior, and other systems may have different approaches

Your Ansible code should not depend on any external conventions, and should ensure that the services
in _your_ infrastructure are configured the way _you_ need it.

Every role that manages a service should therefore always have a task that ensures that:
 - the service is started
 - the service is enabled to run on the system boot

Note that this task should regularly be added **after** the task than manages service configuration.
It will matter in the case when configuration file has syntax error preventing the service from
starting, and the service itself is stopped -- so Ansible should _first_ update the service
configuration file, and only _after_ that try to start the service.

Service can be managed with the Ansible module
[service](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/service_module.html),
it has all we need.

Example task for uWSGI:

    name: uWSGI service
    ansible.builtin.service:
      name: uwsgi
      state: started
      enabled: true

**Note: every service you set up later on this course should have similar task in the role!**

Once added, run the Ansible again -- it should not produce any changes because the service is
already started:

    ansible-playbook infra.yaml

To test if Ansible will actually start the uWSGI service if that was stopped, first stop the service
manually -- run these commands on the managed host:

    sudo systemctl stop uwsgi
    systemctl status uwsgi

The second command output should indicate that the service is stopped, example:

    ‚óè uwsgi.service - LSB: Start/stop uWSGI server instance(s)
         Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/uwsgi; generated)
         Active: inactive (dead) since Sun 2025-09-12 11:13:16 UTC; 14ms ago
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Then, run the Ansible on the controller node:

    ansible-playbook infra.yaml

Ansible logs should indicate the change of the task that manages the service:

    TASK [uwsgi : uWSGI service] ********
    changed: [elvis-1]

Run this command on the managed host to ensure that the service was started:

    systemctl status uwsgi

This should now indicate that the service is running, example:

    ‚óè uwsgi.service - LSB: Start/stop uWSGI server instance(s)
         Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/uwsgi; generated)
         Active: active (running) since Sun 2025-09-12 11:15:21 UTC; 55s ago
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Procedure to test if Ansible will enable the uWSGI service to start on the system boot is similar.
First, disable the service and reboot the instance --
**make sure to run this on the managed host, not elsewhere**:

    sudo systemctl disable uwsgi
    sudo reboot

Wait until the virtual machine reboots (usually 1..2 minutes), connect via SSH and verify that the
uWSGI service is _not_ running:

    systemctl status uwsgi

Run the Ansible on the controller node -- this should start the service on the managed host, and
also re-enable the service to run on the next system boot:

    ansible-playbook infra.yaml

On the managed host, ensure that the service was started; if it was, reboot the machine again:

    systemctl status uwsgi
    sudo reboot

Wait until virtual machine reboots, connect via SSH and verify that the uWSGI service is running:

    systemctl status uwsgi

**Note: from now on, verify every managed service this way at least once!**

This service behavior is a requirement on this course, and it will be checked during the final lab
defence.


## Task 5: Nginx as uWSGI frontend

In the previous lab we've installed Nginx web server that served static documents (default mode).
We'll now need to reconfigure it to "talk" to uWSGI to generate dynamic documents instead.

Update the `nginx` role from the previous lab so that Nginx is configured as a
frontend for uWSGI. For that,

 1. Add new file to your Ansible repository: `roles/nginx/files/default`; this file should contain
    a Nginx configuration as uWSGI frontend -- you can find related examples in the lecture slides
    and in the AGAMA deployment instructions (section 'Running')
 2. Use Ansible module `copy` to replace the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` file on a managed
    host with your copy; this file comes from the APT package `nginx` and you can safely overwrite
    it for our labs.
 3. Ensure that Nginx service is restarted automatically if Nginx configuration is changed; note
    that Nginx service shoud **not** be restarted if Nginx configuration was not changed.
 4. Ensure that Nginx service is started (unconditionally) and enabled to start automatically on
    system boot.

For steps 3 use Ansible handlers, and for step 4 -- Ansible module `service`. Solution here should
be pretty similar to what you did with uWSGI in the previous tasks.

Make sure that Nginx listens on a public interface port 80 -- otherwise your public URL just won't
work. This line in the `server` section of Nginx configuration should solve it:

    listen 80 default_server;

If you feel that examples mentioned above are not enough -- Nginx uWSGI module configuration
reference can be found [here](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_uwsgi_module.html#uwsgi_pass).

`Web servers` play should already contain the `nginx` role from the previous lab; if it doesn't --
add the role after the `uwsgi`.

Once done, run Ansible to reconfigure Nginx, and make sure it executes sucessfully:

    ansible-playbook infra.yaml

Once done, AGAMA should be available at [your public URL](http://193.40.157.25/students.html).

Feel free to click around and break all the things. If you feel that AGAMA app has some issues
please consider [reporting them](https://github.com/hudolejev/agama#contributing).

If you need to 'reset' the app just delete the `/opt/agama/db.sqlite3` file on the managed host;
AGAMA will re-create it (if missing) on the next request.

Hints:
 - Nginx logs can be found in `/var/log/nginx` directory.

**Make sure to verify that Ansible would start and enable the Nginx service properly!**

See previous task for details.


## Expected result

Your repository contains these files and directories; other files may also be there but these are
the ones that we will check:

    ansible.cfg
    hosts
    infra.yaml
    roles/
        agama/
            tasks/main.yaml
        nginx/
            files/default
            tasks/main.yaml
        uwsgi/
            files/agama.ini
            tasks/main.yaml

Your repository also contains all the required files from the previous labs.

AGAMA with uWSGI and Nginx can be installed and configured on empty machine by running exactly this
command exactly once:

    ansible-playbook infra.yaml

Running the same command again does not make any changes on the managed host.

AGAMA web application is available on [your public URL](http://193.40.157.25/students.html).
